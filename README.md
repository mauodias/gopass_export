# gopass_export

This is a simple script to export your gopass passwords to multiple formats. It was created because I got bored with the way that gopass (and pass) work, and wanted to be able to export my passwords to a format that I could use with other tools, or directly to the tools themselves.

It is currently under development. The first version will export to 1password, but I plan to add more formats in the future.
